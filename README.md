# Code&Comment2Markdown = cc2md

Use AST to generate Markdown documentation for components from React TypeScript component code and comments. (code and comment to markdown = cc2md)

## Enjoy

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/wjq990112/cc2md.git
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm compile
```

And then, you'll find a `README.md` file in components dir.
